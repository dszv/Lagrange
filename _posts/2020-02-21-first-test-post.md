The question of carrying out measurements in quantum-mechanical systems and an interpretation of the results so obtained is rightly considered to be very complicated, requiring even today further research. We shall not given a detailed analysis of the problem of quantum-mechanical measurements, but shall try to describe a number of fundamental statements which have been explained clearly, and demonstrate them using some examples. 

## The Origin of the Superposition of States and the Meaning of the Amplitudes of States

Suppose that a micro-particle is in a certain state $$\langle \alpha |$$. According to the principle of superposition, the state $$\langle \alpha |$$ may be expanded in terms of any system of basic states, for example, in the $$\{ | \beta_i \rangle \}$$:
$$
\langle  \alpha | = \sum_i \langle \alpha | \beta_i \rangle \langle \beta_i |
$$

The numbers $$\langle \alpha | \beta_i \rangle$$ in the superposition above are essentially the amplitudes of the states| $$\langle \beta_i |$$ or, more accurately, the amplitudes of the probabilities with which the various basic states $$\langle \beta_i |$$ are "represented" in the state $$\langle \alpha |$$.

Firstly, we shall note that any definite superposition of states in a micro-particle arises as a result of its interaction with the surroundings.

Death is always quite disastrous, messy common and obscene.
