The question of carrying out measurements in quantum-mechanical systems and an interpretation of the results so obtained is rightly considered to be very complicated, requiring even today further research. We shall not given a detailed analysis of the problem of quantum-mechanical measurements, but shall try to describe a number of fundamental statements which have been explained clearly, and demonstrate them using some examples. 

## The Origin of the Superposition of States and the Meaning of the Amplitudes of States

Suppose that a micro-particle is in a certain state $$\langle \alpha \mid $$. According to the principle of superposition, the state $$ \langle \alpha \mid $$ may be expanded in terms of any system of basic states, for example, in the $$ \{ \mid\!\! \beta_i \rangle \} $$:

$$
\begin{equation}\label{T11.1}
\langle  \alpha | = \sum_i \langle \alpha | \beta_i \rangle \langle \beta_i | \tag{1}
\end{equation}
$$

The numbers $$ \langle \alpha \!\!\mid\!\! \beta_i \rangle $$ in the superposition above are essentially the amplitudes of the states $$ \langle \beta_i \mid $$ or, more accurately, the amplitudes of the probabilities with which the various basic states $$ \langle \beta_i \mid $$ are "represented" in the state $$ \langle \alpha \mid $$.

It is appropriate now to make things more precise.

Firstly, we shall note that any definite superposition of states in a micro-particle arises as a result of its interaction with the surroundings. The latter may be some macroscopic body (which is either produced artificially or is a part of the natural external conditions). This macroscopic body is referred to as the _analyser_. The expression $$\eqref{T11.1}$$ should be interpreted in the following way: as a result of the interaction with a particular analyser (in this case, we may speak of a $$\beta $$-analyser), a micro-particle lying in the state $$\langle \alpha \mid$$ is transformed into the superposition state $$\sum _i \langle \alpha \!\!\mid\!\! \beta_i \rangle \langle \beta_i \mid$$.

Taking into account that the quantum-mechanical nature of the superposition state, it may be said that by interacting with the $$\beta $$-analyser, the micro-particle in some sense is "transformed" at once into all the states $$\langle \beta_i \mid$$. Here, the amplitude $$\langle \alpha \!\!\mid\!\! \beta_i \rangle$$ should be treated as the amplitude caused by the indicated interaction of the transition $$\langle \alpha \!\!\mid \rightarrow \langle \beta_i \mid $$. The quantity $$\mid \langle \alpha \!\!\mid\!\! \beta_i \rangle \mid^2 $$ is the probability of finding the micro-particle finally in just the $$\langle \beta_i \mid$$ state. 

Death is always quite disastrous, messy common and obscene.
