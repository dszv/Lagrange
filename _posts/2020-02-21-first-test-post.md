[Transcript of L. V. Tarasov, *Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics*]

The question of carrying out measurements in quantum-mechanical systems and an interpretation of the results so obtained is rightly considered to be very complicated, requiring even today further research. We shall not given a detailed analysis of the problem of quantum-mechanical measurements, but shall try to describe a number of fundamental statements which have been explained clearly, and demonstrate them using some examples. 

## The Origin of the Superposition of States and the Meaning of the Amplitudes of States

Suppose that a micro-particle is in a certain state $\langle \alpha|$. According to the principle of superposition, the state $\langle \alpha |$ may be expanded in terms of any system of basic states, for example, in the $\{ | \beta _i \rangle \}$:
$$
\langle \alpha | = \sum _i \langle \alpha | \beta _i \rangle \langle \beta _i |
$$
The numbers $ \langle \alpha | \beta _i \rangle $ in the superposition above are essentially the amplitudes of the states $\langle \beta _i | $ or, more accurately, the amplitudes of the probabilities with which the various basic states $\langle \beta _i |$ are "represented" in the state $\langle \alpha |$.
